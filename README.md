# gg_mhtml_to_site

Converts MHTML files representing posts from a Google Group into a site.

I was asked to help with converting a group containing photos into something standalone
so this focuses on that use case.

This is my first time really using Rust. I plan to continue learning and improving the code,
but be warned that it is the work of someone pretty unfamiliar with the language.
